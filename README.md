# NBA Scoring Analysis

This project investigates how a player’s height and age impact their scoring performance in the NBA. Using real-world NBA season statistics, we conducted an exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns in scoring output based on physical and demographic variables

## Overview

In the NBA, scoring ability is a core metric used to assess player value, performance, and potential. However, it’s often assumed that taller players or younger, more athletic players naturally score more. This project challenges those assumptions by asking:
	•	Do taller players actually score more points per game?
	•	At what age are NBA players at their scoring peak?
	•	Is there an optimal combination of height and age for maximizing scoring output?

We cleaned and analyzed a multi-season dataset of NBA player statistics using R. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we drew evidence-based conclusions to these questions. The results help contextualize how physical traits (like height) and player development stages (like age) relate to actual on-court performance.

### Interesting Insight

One of the most compelling findings was that height does not strongly correlate with scoring. In fact, many of the league’s top scorers fall within a moderate height range—between 6’3” and 6’7”. These players, often guards or wing players, tend to have more offensive control and scoring opportunities.
Additionally, players peak in scoring between the ages of 26 and 28, highlighting a blend of physical prime and in-game maturity.
Below is a heatmap that visualizes the scoring “sweet spot” across both height and age:
